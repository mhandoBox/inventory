Sorry, but latexmk.exe did not succeed for the following reason:

  MiKTeX could not find the script engine 'perl' which is required to execute 'latexmk'.

Remedy:

  Make sure 'perl' is installed on your system.

The log file hopefully contains the information to get MiKTeX going again:

  C:\Users\mhando\AppData\Local\MiKTeX\miktex\log\latexmk.log
